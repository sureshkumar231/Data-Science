Transforming healthcare with AI-powered disease prediction based on patient data

This project leverages artificial intelligence to build a predictive model that can identify potential diseases based on patient symptom descriptions. The goal is to provide an automated system that can analyze textual descriptions of symptoms and predict the most likely disease associated with those symptoms. The machine learning model is trained on a dataset of disease names and their corresponding descriptions. The system uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for text vectorization, which transforms the textual data into numerical features. This representation is then used to train a Naive Bayes classifier to predict the disease. Once the model is trained, it is evaluated using standard metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to measure its performance. Additionally, a bar chart is generated to visualize the confidence level of the modelâ€™s predictions, showing how confidently the model can predict each disease.

The project is built using Python, and it employs powerful libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, scikit-learn for machine learning, and matplotlib/seaborn for data visualization. The dataset should consist of two columns: Disease (the name of the disease) and Description title (a textual description of the symptoms). The system is designed to handle missing data and text cleaning by dropping rows with missing descriptions. The end goal is to offer a machine learning solution that aids in the early identification of diseases based on symptoms, which can be further integrated into healthcare applications for real-time disease prediction.
